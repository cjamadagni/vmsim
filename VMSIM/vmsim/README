Vmsim is a vritual memory simulator. It is a modified (simplified) 
version of the Vmtrace, from Univ of Washington.  The 
modifications were done by Mohamed Hefeeda of Simon Fraser 
University, Surrey, Canada for CMPT 300 course.

Vmtrace Virtual Memory Trace Simulator

This is a package for evaluating page replacement algorithms against
program traces.

It was developed at the University of Washington for CSE451, and is
available under the GNU GPL. See the file COPYING for more
information.

For instructors:

Use 'make student-dist' to produce a tar.gz without the solutions.

TODO:

- x86 references may cross page boundaries. They may also be larger than
  the bus size, and should thus count as multiple memory accesses. We
  currently consider every reference, regardless of size or allignment
  to be a single reference to the page on which it starts.
